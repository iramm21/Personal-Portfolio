Isaac's Developer Portfolio
Welcome to my personal developer portfolio! This website showcases my skills and projects, focusing on web development using modern technologies such as React and Node.js. As I grow, I plan to expand the portfolio to include other areas of expertise.

Project Overview
This portfolio is designed to demonstrate my capabilities as a web developer. It includes examples of my work, details about the services I offer, and information about my technical skills. Currently, the portfolio focuses on programming websites, as I have gained enough confidence to begin offering this as a professional service.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive design
Node.js and Express (potentially): Backend technologies for server-side logic and API integration, which may be added as needed
Features
A clean, responsive design for easy navigation across devices
Project showcases with descriptions and links
An about section to introduce myself and my development journey
A contact form for inquiries and potential work opportunities
Future Plans
While the current version of my portfolio focuses on front-end development with React, I plan to:

Expand the portfolio with additional services and skills as I continue to grow
Integrate a backend using Node.js and Express for enhanced functionality
Add more projects and case studies as I complete them
Possibly include a blog to document my learning and share insights on development
